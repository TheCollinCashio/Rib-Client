# Rib-Client
Rib-Client is a client library to access the Rib backend framework. This should be coupled with [rib-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rib-server) to create a simple real-time application. Rib-Client allows you to call server-side functions directly from the client.

For the official github, please click [here](https://github.com/TheCollinCashio/Rib).

## Example
```js
let RibClient = require('rib-client').default // or import using a CDN
let myRib = new RibClient('http://localhost:5000/')

myRib.onConnect(async () => {
    myRib.logMessage('Runs the logMessage function server side üë®üèª‚Äçüíª')
    console.log(await myRib.add(1, 2))
})

function sendMSG(msg) {
    console.log(msg)
}

myRib.exposeFunctions([sendMSG])   //  allows us to call sendMSG from the server
```

## Documentation
**The default constructor takes two parameters:**
```

```
